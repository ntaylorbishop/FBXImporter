DEEP LEARNING

	When you don't know what you're doing or exactly how your pipeline works, don't try to set up your pipeline right away. It will change. First get everything working, get something on the screen and feeling good,
	then pull things out one by one. I got so caught up in how I would incorporate everything into my engine (And indeed, I was building it into my engine) that I became increasingly hesitant to write anything that
	I wasn't absolutely sure about. At some point I had to let go of my insecurity in what I was writing to just write something that worked and worry about refactoring and cleaning it up at a later time. This exponentially
	increased my productivity and it felt good getting stuff working. In that regard, I began to gain a more intuitive sense of what my pipeline would eventually be, and it makes refactoring much quicker and better.
